# README.md

So this is a random crate that im using to learn rust.
So don't expect anything good, except for the documentation,
I love doing that kind of thing.

Tests for public functions are located in `tests/`
with tests for private functions being at the end of the file they are made in.
All functions have documentation, including private functions
(which I'm sad isn't actually included in the `cargo doc`, but it makes sense).
